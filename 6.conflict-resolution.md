# Conflict resolution

Sometimes the union of two branches is not so good, but a conflict occurs, this when the commits of the branch to merge and the current branch modify the same part in a particular file and git cannot decide which version to choose, and warns you that you must solve it. For example:

# Solving conflicts

First we will create a conflict situation:

1. Create new branch

```
$ git checkout -b feature-update-text
```

2. Update `new.txt` file with:

```
Hi world and tingo maria
by condef5
```

3. Add commit

```
$ git add new.txt
$ git commit -m "Update new.txt"
```

4. Switch branch

```
$ git checkout master
```

5. Update `new.txt` file with:

```
Hi world
by desert
```

6. Add commit

```
$ git add new.txt
$ git commit -m "Add author"
```

7. Merge brach

```
$ git merge feature-update-text
```

8. The merge of the branches gives us an error message

9. Show the content of file `new.txt`

`$ nano new.txt`

![new.text](/__docs__/new-text.png)

10. Solved conflicts (update the content)

![new.text](/__docs__/final-text.png)

11. Add the new changes in a commit

```
$ git add new.txt
$ git commit -m "Merge changes"
```

12. Show the history

```
$ git log
```

## You turn

In a group of 3 or 4 people, perform at least one of the following tasks:

1. Create a new branch in the repository created previously.
2. choose a file in specific and update the name (for generate a conflict).
3. Push the new branch and create a pull request.
4. Merge the pull request in repository.
